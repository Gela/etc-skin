# etc-skin
Reskin etc webapp
[BETA]

An alternate skin for the electronic time card webapp used by esri.

Features:
- View related wbs numbers
- View project details
- Fluid layout that takes advantage of larger screens
- Improved ui including larger, and prettier buttons, and icons

Requirements: Certain features require the use of a custom script plugin that will run some javascript when you load the page. This javascript just adds some click handlers and classes to make the new stuff work. I suggest [CJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en). Once the plugin is installed, paste the javascript from the [script.js file](script.js) into the cjs menu and click save. Note: Make sure you enable jquery 2.1 or higher in the cjs menu.
